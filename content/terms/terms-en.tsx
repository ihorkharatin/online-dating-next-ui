      <h3>WHAT IS SEX TRAFFICKING?</h3>
      <p>
        Sex trafficking is a type of human trafficking. Human trafficking is the
        trading of men, women and children for the purpose of servitude and
        forced labor. It is one of the fastest growing criminal industries in
        the world. In sex trafficking, women (usually) are traded within and
        between countries for sex work. The women are usually deceived and lured
        into prostitution with a promise of a job or some other opportunity that
        sounds too good to be true.
      </p>
      <h3>WARNING SIGNS</h3>
      <p>
        Spotting a sex trafficker while you’re trying to find a special someone
        can be a hard ask but here are some signs to look out for:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>· Instant Love.</strong> If he’s professing his undying love
        within a few days of knowing you, there’s more than one reason to think
        there might be something wrong here. The first step to trapping their
        potential victim is to get her emotionally involved. Therefore, it is
        always advisable to take the time to get to know other members on the
        site as someone you have only known for a few days is more likely to be
        a fraud than someone you have been chatting with for a few months.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>· Job Promises.</strong> This is the most common bait sex
        traffickers use. They will usually promise you a job, tell you to come
        to a different country where you can work (often as a waitress), promise
        you big money and the like. But when you reach the other country,
        there’s no job waiting for you and most often these sex traffickers use
        the promise of a job to trick and coerce women into prostitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>· Willingness to Pay.</strong> There are a number of men out
        there who are genuinely willing to sponsor their girlfriend to be able
        to visit them. While most men are legitimate, there are some who use
        this as a ploy and girls are often forced into prostitution and
        subsequently made to “pay off the debt”. Not everyone is trying to dupe
        you but if someone’s behavior is suspicious and they are over eager for
        you visit them, you should think twice. For example, if you have only
        been chatting with them for a few days and they are offering to pay for
        everything already, it could be dodgy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you have known the other member for a long time and they are
        willing to pay for you, it is more likely to be genuine. The best thing
        to do would be to ask the man to visit you instead of you visiting him,
        as this is infinitely safer. Only someone who is genuinely interested in
        you is likely to make the effort to come and meet you. Also, since you
        will be in familiar territory it will be harder to deceive you and since
        it is your home town, you can easily call for help if there is any
        trouble.
      </p>
      <h3>HOW TO STAY SAFE</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some quick tips to stay safe online: Always keep your guard up
        and take the time to get to know another member before you make plans to
        meet them. It is much safer if you ask him to visit you rather than you
        going to an unknown city or country. If someone is offering you illegal
        jobs in their country or making other tall promises to you, don’t take
        the bait and report the member to the dating site’s administrators
        instead. {website} prohibits from using the app and {website} to solicit
        others for services or activities of any nature. The platform is
        designed for genuine connections and interactions, and any form of

        solicitation, or engagement in any escort services on our platform.

          Additional Terms: Policy on Reporting Solicitation, Escort Services,
          and Monetary Requests
        </strong>{" "}
        — At {website}, fostering a secure and respectful environment is our
        utmost priority. We strictly prohibit solicitation, escort services, or
        monetary requests, whether communicated directly between members or
        posted within a member’s profile. To ensure the safety and integrity of
        our community, we have established a clear reporting procedure. If you
        encounter any member soliciting prostitution, offering escort services,
        requesting money, or if you find such content within a member’s profile
        information, we urge you to take immediate action:

        ‘Report’ button, you will be prompted to select a reason for your
        report. Choose ‘Solicitation / Escort / Requesting Money’ from the list
        of options to indicate the nature of the violation accurately. <br />
        <strong>Submit Your Report:</strong> Once you’ve selected the
        appropriate category, confirm your action by clicking the ‘Report’
        button to finalize your submission. This notifies our team, who will
        then review the report and take necessary actions in alignment with our

      <p>
        Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party
        to the other Party.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute arising from the
        relationships between the Parties to these Legal Terms shall be
        determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the
        Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration
        being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in
        Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for
        arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes

      <ul>
        <li>(a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>
        <li>
          (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on
          a class-action basis or to utilise class action procedures; and
        </li>
        <li>
          (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.</strong>{" "}
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
        arbitration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the

        <li>
          (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
          piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and
        </li>
        <li>
          (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
          illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
          any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.
        </li>

      <h2>23. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
      <p>
        These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
        the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
        agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
        or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate
        as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the
        fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our
        rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be
        responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
        caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is
        determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
        part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and
        does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
        provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
        relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms
        or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be
        construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive
        any and all defences you may have based on the electronic form of these
        Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute
        these Legal Terms.
